   PHP Framework. This lightweight and modular framework is designed to 
   help developers build web applications easily, while providing a clean and organized codebase. 
   Under development stage.

## Requirements
   - PHP 8+
   - PHP V8js extension

## Installation
   To get started with skBase, clone the repository and include the init.php file in your application:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/novatekz/skbase.git
   ```

   In your application entry point (e.g., index.php), include the following:
   ```php
   <?php
   require 'sk/init.php';                                           
        // your code goes here
   ```
   After doing so read the documentation for coding with skBase

## Configuration
   You can configure various aspects of the framework by modifying 
   the configuration files located in the `sk/conf` directory. Key configuration files include:
   
       app.php      : General application settings.
       auth.php     : Authentication-related configurations.
       database.php : Database connection settings.
       mail.php     : Email configurations.
       plugins.php  : Manage active plugins.

## Features
   - **ReactJS:** Easily implement React components to render on the server-side with PHP as well as on the client. _*V8js required_
   - **Routing:** Simplified routing system that maps URLs to controllers and actions, making it easy to manage application routes.
   - **Middleware support:** Implement m.w. for authentication, CSRF protection, and other request processing tasks.
   - **Database:** Built-in support for multiple databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) with easy-to-use database classes.
   - **Cryptography:** Secure your application with various cryptographic methods, including AES and SHA hashing.
   - **Localization:** Support for multiple languages with a fallback mechanism for missing translations.
   - **Plugin System:** Extend the framework's functionality with plugins, enabling you to add features without modifying the core code.
   - **Helpers:** Utility functions for common tasks, such as JSON handling, string manipulation, and array operations.
   - **Logging and caching:** Built-in support for logging application events and caching data to improve performance.
        
## Structure
   The framework files are located in the `sk` directory, 
   while the app that is made with skBase is located outside `sk` directory.
   Application files will load `sk/init.php` to initialize framework and 
   load everything needed by the app and the framework itself.

### conf/
   `app.php`   - general settings       <br>
   `db.php`    - database configuration if needed
   
### core/
`basic/controller.php` - base class for all controllers     <br>

`helpers/json.php`      - functions for handling json data  <br>
`helpers/string.php`    - string manipulatipn functions

`lang/fallback.php`     - fallback english default language file, in case language isnt selected    <br>
`lang/xx_XX.php`        - xx language file for XX region

`middleware/AuthMiddleware.php` - middleware for auth checks                            <br>

### plugins/
   here goes additional plugins for the framework, providing additional functionality. 
   to activate/deactivate a specific plugin, the directory name should be specified in `sk/conf/plugins.php`. 
   to prevent a specific plugin from ever being loaded by the framework even if it is specified in the previously mentioned config file, its directory name must start with a dot.
